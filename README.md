# PluginPatchPlugin

The `PluginPatchPlugin` plugin for webpack 5 allows you to patch other Webpack plugins with updated options at runtime.

This plugin is usefull in many situations, e.g. if the primary webpack configuration is generated by a build tool and only merges your custom configurations where you can only add but can not replace plugin settings. Also if you need to dynamically adjust your build in unpredictable cases, safe time and patch your process at runtime.

> [!CAUTION]
> Use this plugin with caution! Using this plugin might cause huge side-effects and could break your build process. 

## Getting Started

To begin, you'll need to install `plugin-patch-plugin`:

``` console
npm install --save-dev plugin-patch-plugin
```

or

``` console
yarn add -D plugin-patch-plugin
```

or

``` console
pnpm add -D plugin-patch-plugin
```

## Plugin Arguments

| Name             | Type               | Explanation |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | - | 
| pluginIdentifier | Function \| string | Either the pluginâ€™s constructor (class) or its constructor name as a string. |
| patchOption      | object             | The new options you want to override/merge for the patched plugin.<br> Review the [documentation of the plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/) that you want to patch. You can provide all or any subset of the options of the target plugin. The provided options will be merged with the options of the existing plugin before replacing it with a new instance of the plugin based on the new options.|
| hookName         | string             | Optional name of the compiler hook to tap into, defaults to 'environment'.<br> See https://webpack.js.org/api/compiler-hooks/ for a list of available hooks. |

## Example

``` javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new optimize.LimitChunkCountPlugin({
        maxChunks: 5
    }),
    new PluginPatchPlugin(optimize.LimitChunkCountPlugin, {
        maxChunks: 10
    })
  ]
}
```

In this example, during runtime, early in the build process, the `PluginPatchPlugin` replaces the `LimitChunkCountPlugin` with a new instance of the plugin with option `maxChunk = 10`.
The `PluginPatchPlugin` remains in the array of plugins but will not do anything else further in the process.

At runtime, after the The PluginPatchPlugin has been run, the plugins array of your configuration will look like this:

``` javascript
  plugins: [
    new optimize.LimitChunkCountPlugin({
        maxChunks: 10 // changed
    }),
    new PluginPatchPlugin(optimize.LimitChunkCountPlugin, {
        maxChunks: 10
    })
  ]
